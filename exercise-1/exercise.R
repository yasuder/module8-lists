# Exercise 1: Lists

# Create a vector of everything you ate for breakfast
breakfast.list <- c("milk", "eggs", "toast", "cereal", "waffles", "muffins", "orange", "apple")

# Create a vector of everything you ate for lunch
lunch.list <- c("water", "rice", "pork", "egg", "granola", "cookie")

# Create a list "meals" that has contains your `breakfast` and `lunch`
meals <- list(breakfast = breakfast.list, lunch = lunch.list)

# Add a "dinner" element to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals$dinner <- c("pasta", "alfredo", "cider", "brownies")

# Use dollar notation to extract your `dinner` element from your list
# and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
dinner <- meals$dinner

# Use double-bracket notation to extract your `lunch` element from your list
# and save it in your list as the element at index 5 (no reason)
meals[[5]] <- meals[['lunch']]
print(meals[['lunch']])
print(meals)

# Use single-bracket notation to extract your breakfast and lunch from your list
# and save them to a list called `early.meals`
early.meals <- meals[1:2]


### Bonus ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function
meal.num <- lapply(meals, length)
print(meal.num)

# Write a function that adds pizza to every meal
Pizza <- function(food) {
  return(paste(food, "pizza"))
}

# Add pizza to every meal!
pizzas <- lapply(meals, Pizza)
print(pizzas)
